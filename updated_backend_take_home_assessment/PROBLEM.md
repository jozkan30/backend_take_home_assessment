## Problem

For this problem, you will develop a few HTTP APIs to perform some simple functions on daily stock prices. For the
source of prices, please use the AlphaVantage [TIME_SERIES_DAILY](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#daily) API
endpoint. You can get a free API key for AlphaVantage from [here](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key). Note
that this key is limited to 25 calls per day.

We have provided some boilerplate that includes commonly-used tools for backend development at Sixth Street. We
encourage you to use these for your implementation but you are free to use other tools and setups as long your solution
is implemented in Python.

We estimate that this should take no more than a few hours to complete (or slightly longer for anyone unfamiliar with
Python or the suggested tools).  Feel free to make compromises based on time-boxing this to a couple of hours. This
exercise is meant to get a general sense of how you write software and how you design APIs; it's not meant to be a
bulletproof production solution.

## Requirements

Create the following 3 endpoints:
  1. `lookup`: given a symbol and a date, return the open, high, low, close, and volume for that symbol on that date.
      The response should be in this format:
      ```json
      {
        "open": 127.1000, 
        "high": 128.2900,
        "low": 126.5300,
        "close": 127.9600,
        "volume": 3671903
      }
      ```
  2. `min`: given a symbol and a range 'n', return the lowest price that symbol traded at over the last 'n' days (i.e.
      lowest low). The response should be in this format:
      ```json
      {
        "min": 122.685
      }
      ```
  3. `max`: given a symbol and a range 'n', return the highest price that symbol traded at over the last 'n' days (i.e.
     highest high). The response should be in this format:
      ```json
      {
        "max": 128.93
      }
      ```

A lazy-loaded cache should be implemented. The first time a given symbol is requested, hit the AlphaVantage API and
cache the results. Subsequent requests for the same symbol should be served out of the cache.

## Deliverables

### Software

A solution implemented in Python with instructions on how to run locally and how to call the endpoints via `curl`.

### Discussion

A short write-up where you discuss the following:

  - What compromises did you make due to time constraints?
  - What would you do differently if this software was meant for production use?
  - Propose how you might implement authentication, such that only authorized users may hit these endpoints.
  - How much time did you spend on this exercise?
  - Please include any other comments about your implementation.
  - Please include any general feedback you have about the exercise.
