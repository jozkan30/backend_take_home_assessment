# Solution Boilerplate

As mentioned in the problem statement, feel free to use your own development tools and stack
as long as your solution is implemented in Python.

This boilerplate requires a Unix-like environment. For Windows users, this should work with
[WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).

To get started, install the following:
  - [Python 3.12](https://docs.python.org/3.12/)
  - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
  - [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

Then, run `make run` to start the application.

Before submitting your solution, make sure to update the project details in `pyproject.toml`!
